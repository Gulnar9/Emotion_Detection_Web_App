# Introduction
In this practice project, you will be introduced to the creation of a web app integrated with Watson AI libraries to perform sentiment analysis on the provided text. The sentiment analysis web application categorizes text inputs as different types of emotion, specifically: joy, sadness, anger, disgust or fear. The application was built using Watson Embedded AI Libraries and NLP BERT Seniment Analysis model. This repository recreates the steps that were performed to build the web app.

The application was deployed over the web using Flask framework. Also to check validity of application performance, we applied unittests, followed by PEP8 coding guidelines and error handling. All activities that get you to deploy a functional AI-based web apps are broken down into tasks as listed below.

# Project Tasks
Task 1: Clone the project repository
As a start, we clone the GitHub repository of the project using Cloud IDE terminal: https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/zzrjt-practice-project-emb-ai.git < br / >

Task 2: Create a sentiment analysis application using Watson NLP library
For creating the sentiment analysis application, we will use Watson Embedded AI Libraries. The written function will receive text as an input and return detected emotion as a response. < br / >

Task 3: Format the output of the application
We modify response received from the application in a dictionary format to make it more user-friendly.

Task 4: Package the application
Organizing our files into the package for further application launching

Task 5: Run Unit tests on your application
Before deployment, we test the performance of our application.

Task 6: Deploy as web application using Flask
Deploying our application as a web application using Flask framework.

Task 7: Incorporate error handling
Updating emotion_detection function to handle different error codes, invalid string inputs.

Task 8: Run static code analysis
We check the quality of our coding skills as per the PEP8 guidelines by running static code analysis.

End result of these tasks is an emotion detection application accessible over the web interface.
